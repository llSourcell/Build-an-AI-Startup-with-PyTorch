        "- Dialogflow (Previously known as API.AI) is where the magic happens. \n",
        "- It works on natural language processing and backed by Machine Learning . \n",
        "- At Dialogflow the whole ‘conversation’ take place. Dialogflow is backed by Google and runs on Google infrastructure, which means you can scale to millions of users.\n",
        "- Give users new ways to interact with your product by building engaging voice and text-based conversational interfaces powered by AI. \n",
        "- Connect with users on the Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa, Facebook Messenger, and other popular platforms and devices. \n",
        "- The process a Dialogflow agent follows from invocation to fulfillment is similar to someone answering a question, with some liberties taken of course.\n",

        "\n",
        "- If the user requesting to speak to our agent — an  invocation is detected using the recognisable terms that we define in the Dialogflow console. \n",
        "- This allows us, as the developers, to define the way in which our conversational experience is started\n",

        "\n",
        "- An Intent is a specific action that the user can invoke by using one of the defined terms in the Dialogflow console.\n",
        "- For example, the user could ask “Is it going to rain today?” or “Where is the nearest pizza restaurant” — if these are terms defined within the console, then they will be detected by Dialogflow and the intent that are defined under will be triggered.\n",

        "\n",
        "- An Intent allows us as developers to define a selection of individual tasks that can be invoked by the user. \n",
        "- You should aim to keep these intents focused and concentrate on the functionality that they are crated for, this allows us to keep the length of the invocation short and give the user the desired response in a shorter time frame.\n",

        "\n",
        "- Within our Intent we are able to define a list of User Says options — this allow us to define different phrases which can be said by the user in order to trigger our intent.\n",
        "\n",
        "![alt text](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*5EeD9Sz7wIdRGGMqyAdCkQ.png)\n",
        "\n",
        "- The more User Says options that we define, the easier it will be for users to trigger their desired Intent. Above you can see a list of varying options, but it would be possible for me to grow this even further. \n",

        "\n",
        "- An Entity is a property which can be used by Dialogflow to answer the request from the user — the entity will usually be a keyword within the request such as a name, date, location etc. \n",
        "- When the user speaks or types their request, Dialogflow will look for the entity and the value of the given entity can be used within the request.\n",
        "\n",
        "![alt text](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*L8AA6r9hfFntfY2NH7WTjA.png)\n",
        "\n",
        "- On the left-hand side you define the value for the Entity, this is the value to be used when the Entity is detected by the system. \n",
        "- And on the right-hand side are the synonyms for each value — this allows us to define the different phrases that can be used for the entity, allowing us to provide a greater chance at recognising the users request.\n",
        "\n",
        "![alt text](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*X6wW0ntdUeUk5xclQViOmA.png)\n",
        "\n",
        "- At this point, Dialogflow has the request from the user (along with the entity values to be sent with the request), so it now needs to request the information to fulfil the users request. \n",
        "- Now this data is to be sent to our web-hook so that the required information can be fetched (this will be dependant on your implementation). \n",
        "- Once the web-hook has fetched our required information it will send it back to Dialogflow so that it can be presented to the user in the desired manner.\n",

        "\n",
        "- The response is the content which Dialogflow will deliver to our User once the request for fulfilment has completed. \n",
        "- On devices with screens this will consist of textual content and rich content if present — the textual content will be spoken to the user. On hardware devices without screens the content will only be read out to the user.\n",
        "- The Context is used to keep a reference to parameter values as the user moves between intents throughout the conversation. \n",
        "- Context is a powerful concept as it allows us to make decisions in our responses based off of these previous responses, repair conversations that may become broken for any reason and also branch off into different intents to create a fluid conversation with the user.\n",

        "- Normally, it would take you months to set up your own authentication system. And even after that, you would need to keep a dedicated team to maintain that system. But if you use Firebase, you can set up the entire system in under 10 lines of code that will handle everything for you, including complex operations like account merging.\n"
